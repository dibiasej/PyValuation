# PyValuation

A library for stock and portfolio valuation.
This was originally made to help aid in my own stock valuation approach but I wanted to allow others to utilize this code as well.
The library is made up of four basic parent classes that inherent from two child classes.
The four parent classes are DCF, Valuation, RelativeValue and PortfolioValuation and the two child classes are FinancialData and ValuationCharts.
